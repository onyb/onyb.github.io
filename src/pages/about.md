I am Ani, a Software Engineer based in Paris. I work at [Ledger](https://ledger.com),
in the [Vault](https://ledger.com/vault) team,
building cryptocurrency custody software for financial institutions.

My current interests include math-based currencies, decentralized finance, and
programmable money. I'm building for the next decade.
