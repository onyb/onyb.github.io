Hey there, I'm Ani! Welcome to my personal website. This space is
work-in-progress, but while you're here, I would like to share a few things
about who I am, and what I do.

I am a strong proponent of freedom currencies. My mission is to do my part in
the grand democratization of money, which I'm convinced is the next phase of
our civilization. I spent 5 years working in love-city Paris, most notably on
cryptocurrencies, and recently moved to Bangalore for filter coffee, dosas,
and in search of a local community that aligns with my mission.

Currently, I'm a Wallet Engineer at [Brave](https://brave.com), where I'm
building an internet-scale native crypto wallet. Previously, I worked at
[Ledger](https://ledger.com) building a cryptocurrency custody product for
financial institutions securing billions of dollars in assets.
