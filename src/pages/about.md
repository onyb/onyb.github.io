Hey there, I'm Ani! Welcome to my personal website. This space is work-in-progress,
but while you're here, I want to share a few things about who I am, and what I do.

I am a strong proponent of freedom currencies. My mission in life is to do my part in the grand democratization
of money. I spent 5 years working in Paris, mostly on cryptocurrency-tech, and recently moved
to Bangalore for new adventures.

Currently, I'm a Wallet Engineer at [Brave](https://brave.com), where I'm building an internet-scale native crypto
wallet. Previously, I worked at [Ledger](https://ledger.com) building a cryptocurrency custody product for financial
institutions securing billions of dollars in assets.
