<h4>Hi! My name is Ani.</h4>

<p>
  My mission is to transform complex blockchain protocols into intuitive and
  enjoyable experiences that bring Web3 to the masses. I firmly believe that
  money should be non-custodial, and its security properties should be
  underpinned by math.

  A generational shift in what we understand as <i>money</i> is underway and
  is taking the world by storm - one block at a time.

  I'm currently a Staff Engineer at <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a>,
  where I work on Web3 initiatives notably the multi-chain
  <a href="https://brave.com/wallet">Brave Wallet</a>.
